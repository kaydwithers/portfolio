            In mid 2016, Isobar commenced development on a responsive website for Holden. The site was built with reusability as a focus. It features Handlebar templating which allows us to focus on modularisation and absolute consistency. The site is built with Vue.js and uses ITCSS CSS architecture. I have been involved in development on the Holden website for over a year.
